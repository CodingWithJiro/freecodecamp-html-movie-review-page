## Movie Review: Zootopia (2016)

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

A simple, structured movie review webpage using semantic HTML. Created as part of the **[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/)** HTML5 free course.

---

## Overview

This static project presents a review of Disney’s _Zootopia_ (2016), including a brief synopsis, cast list, movie rating, and poster image which are all built with accessibility and metadata in mind.

This site demonstrates how to combine semantic structure, meaningful metadata, and accessible markup. It simulates a blog-style review layout that could easily be expanded into a full entertainment or film critique site.

---

## Features

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Open Graph metadata for social sharing
- Descriptive `<meta>` and `<title>` tags
- Accessible use of `<strong>`, `<ul>`, and image `alt` attributes
- Stylized movie rating using stars with a screen reader-friendly numerical rating
- Proper use of `<footer>` and `<main>` landmarks

---

## What I Learned

- How to write structured movie content using semantic elements
- The role of Open Graph `<meta>` tags in link previews
- How to combine visual emojis or characters (like stars) with screen reader-accessible ratings using `aria-hidden`
